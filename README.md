# Face-Mask-Detection

## 📖 Overview
The Face Mask Detection System is a real-time application that detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. It leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to help ensure public safety by monitoring compliance with mask regulations.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a system to detect face masks in real-time.
- Enable effective monitoring of mask usage in public spaces.
- Provide accurate and efficient mask detection using pre-trained models.

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 🔍 Detection Process
- Uses OpenCV and a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.
- Applies deep learning models to classify if a detected face has a mask or not.

### 📈 Model Training
- Trained on diverse datasets containing images of people with and without masks.
- Optimized model performance using techniques like data augmentation.

### 🎨 Real-Time Application
- Processes live video streams and images for mask detection.
- Displays bounding boxes around detected faces with labels indicating "Mask" or "No Mask."
